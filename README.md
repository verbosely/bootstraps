# bootstraps

These are reusable Bash programs for downloading, configuring, building, and
installing software from source or for adding third-party repositories and
their OpenPGP public keys to the APT package management system on Debian-family
systems. All scripts require superuser privileges. For scripts that add
third-party repositories to APT, sources are added to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`
and public keys are added to `/usr/share/keyrings/`.

## Usage

Invoke a script with the `-h|--help` option to display a brief summary of the
program and a usage synopsis. 

## Contributing

This is not an open source project.
